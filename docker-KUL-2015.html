# Docker and Ansible for Optimization and Scientific Computing

  ## Problem description and challenge
]
.right-column[
*Quantego* runs stochastic optimization on behalf of our clients to help them find solutions to tricky problems, like:

- hydro storage management
- gas storage valuation
- risk control
- anything that can be modelled and has stochastic inputs

For the last 2 years this all happened in Java. While Java has good performance, it's too complicated for ad-hoc prototyping.

The solution: **hosted Jupyter (formerly iPython)** 

- [interactive](https://github.com/quantego/quasar-samples/blob/master/AggregatePlanning.ipynb)
- integrate common tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn
- connect external data sources
- simplify modelling language
- quickly solve common problems (CSV import, reporting, etc)

Brave new world, except that Jupyter/iPython was not really designed to be hosted externally. Their main usecase is running it locally.

  ## Problems we ran into
]
.right-column[
Once you start using iPython as basis for your own application and people access it over the internet, you start hitting roadblocks:

- security (multi-user authentication, SSL)
- persistent file storage (notebooks and other files)
- resource allocation (RAM, CPU)

How have others solved this:

- EC2 images (e.g. Å·hat)
- OpenVZ (e.g. wakari.io)

Which leads to new issues:

- update packages (update image, then restart all instances?)
- share notebooks (shared NFS drive?)

  ## Stack intro
]
.right-column[
In the last years a range of technologies has come available that helped us to solve many of our issues in elegant ways:

### Docker
- lightweight process virtualization based on libcontainer/LXC
- avoids overhead of OS virtualization

### Nginx
- lightweight proxy server, also handles websockets, SSL and authentication.

### Ansible
- hits the sweet spot in terms of configuration management
- higher level than Fabric, but less complicated than Puppet

  ## Combining Docker and Ansible
]
.right-column[
- Docker by itself is hard to handle, once you have many containers
- `docker-compose` is suitable for development
- Ansible give you all the tools to manage Docker and their deployment in a sclable way.

```
  - docker:
      name: "{{ image_name }}_{{ subdomain }}"
      image: "quantego/quasar:{{ image_tag }}"
      ports: "{{ host_port }}:8888"
      env:
        QUASAR_JAR: "path to java"
      volumes: 
        - "/srv/notebooks/...:/home/swuser/..."
        - "...:...:ro"

  - template:
      src: templates/nginx.j2 
      dest: "/etc/nginx/conf.d/{{ subdomain }}.conf" 

  - service:
      name: nginx
      state: reloaded
```

  ## Define another Docker instance
]
.right-column[
To start another container, all it takes is these configurations. In a much larger deployment, those could also be on different servers or in a DB.

`demo.yml`
```
subdomain: demo
image_tag: dev
stage: dev
notebooks: demo
htpasswd: quantego
```

To deploy:

`ansible-playbook deploy.yml -e @demo.yml`

  ## Benefits
]
.right-column[
This setup gives us the following benefits:

- quick and **flexible** to deploy new instances
- **cheap** to run an additional instance. (~30MB of RAM)
- quick to **distribute updates**, users get latest packages when they restart their notebook kernel, quick to update docker image.
- nginx handels **SSL and authentication** (could use http auth request)
- resources can be **limited** in CPU cores or RAM
- notebooks are managed **centrally**, easy to backup.
]

.left-column[
  ## Remaining issues
]
.right-column[
For our use this setup works. Issues that are left for us:

- **Docker** is not yet 100% secure and breaking out of a container is not imbossible.
- Avoid running processes inside docker as root (needs proper rights management)
- **Websockets** are stable in iPython 3, but still don't survive a network change (VPN, 3G, etc)
- Memory and CPU allocation issues when people run docker on their local machines
