# Scaling iPython deployments with Docker containers and Mongodb

  ## Problem description and challenge
]
.right-column[
*Quantego* runs stochastic optimization on behalf of our clients to help them find solutions to tricky problems, like:

- hydro storage management
- gas storage valuation
- risk control
- anything that can be modelled and has stochastic inputs

For the last 2 years this all happened in Java. While Java has good performance, it's too complicated for ad-hoc prototyping.

The solution: **hosted iPython** 

- interactive
- integrate common tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn
- connect external data sources
- simplify modelling language
- quickly solve common problems (CSV import, reporting, etc)

Brave new world, except that iPython was not really designed to be hosted externally. Their main usecase is running it locally.

  ## Problems we ran into
]
.right-column[
Once you start using iPython as basis for your own application and people access it over the internet, you start hitting roadblocks:

- websockets disconnects (many providers cut long-running)
- security (multi-user authentication, SSL)
- persistent file storage (notebooks and other files)
- resource allocation (RAM, CPU)

How have others solved this:

- EC2 images (e.g. Å·hat)
- OpenVZ (e.g. wakari.io)

Which leads to new issues:

- update packages (update image, then restart all instances?)
- share notebooks (shared NFS drive?)

  ## Stack intro
]
.right-column[
In the last year(s) a range of technologies has come available that helped us to solve many of our issues in elegant ways:

### Docker
- lightweight process virtualization based on libcontainer/LXC
- avoids overhead of OS virtualization

### Mongo
- over-hyped JSON-based document storage
- not suitable for classic homogeneous data, but a good fit for storing notebooks and checkpoints

### Nginx
- lightweight proxy server, also handles websockets, SSL and authentication.

### Ansible
- hits the sweet spot in terms of configuration management
- higher level than Fabric, but less complicated than Puppet

  ## Benefits
]
.right-column[
This setup gives us the following benefits:

- **cheap** to run an additional instance. (~30MB of RAM)
- quick to **distribute updates**, users get latest packages when they restart their notebook kernel
- nginx handels **SSL and authentication** (could use http auth request)
- instances can be **limited** in CPU cores or RAM
- notebooks and checkpoints are managed **centrally**
- **checkpoints** are actually working
- **external data sources** are accessed via ORM and users get latest data when they run their notebooks.
- collectd on host can **monitor** containers

  ## Remaining issues
]
.right-column[
For our use this setup works. For larger installations be aware of the following unsolved issues:

- **Docker** is not yet 100% secure and breaking out of a container is not imbossible ([according](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7909622) to maintainers about 3 months ago)
- Avoid running processes inside docker as root (needs proper rights management)
- **Websockets** are stable in iPython 3, but still don't survive a network change (VPN, 3G, etc)
- **Mongo** has a document size limit of 16MB. Notebooks can't exceed this size.
- Ordinary files *could* live in Mongo as well, but then the size limit could quickly become a problem. **GridFS** could be used to work around this, but we didn't test it yet.
