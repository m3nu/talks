## Why it Works
### Primary effects

.right-column[
### Primary effects of high-fat diet
- Fat is a cleaner fuel.red[a, b, c, d, e] > less cellular damager > reduced aging and cancer
- Fewer fluctuations in blood sugar > stable energy
- Low insulin keeps cells insulin sensitive
- Reduced mTOR growth hormones > reduced aging and cancer
- Body oxidizes fat instead of storing it.

.footnote[
  .red[a] Carbs only give 4 calories energy per g vs 9 cal/g for fat. While burning fat, 30% less carbon dioxide is produced which points to fewer by-products.

### Secondary benefits of a high-fat diet
- Reduced appetite and fewer meals.red[h] > autophagy.red[b] and apoptosis.red[c]
- Avoid fructose > useless to the body, processed like alcohol, stored as visceral fat around organs..red[f, g]
- Avoid wheat > reduce chronic inflammation.red[a]
- Avoid polyunsaturated fat > reduce cancer risk and inflammation.red[e]
- Eat more nutritionally dense food
- Fewer fermentable carbohydrates > less tooth decay..red[d]

## How-To
### Getting Started
]
.right-column[
### Reduce carbohydrates by changing your macro-nutrients

There are 3 macro-nutrients:
- *Carbohydrates*: Intake dramatically increased since 1960s..red[a]
- *Fat*: Safest food of all, no insulin reaction, clean and efficient fuel
- *Protein*: Constant at 0.8g.red[b]per kg ideal body weight.

How to start your ketogenic diet:
- Shift macros from carbs to fat, protein constant.
- Less than 20g net carbs per day.
- 2 weeks adaption phase, with temporary side-effects.red[d]
- Short fasting periods, e.g. 16:8 hours can be helpful.
- Track food intake in the first weeks.

.footnote[
  .red[a] Possible Reasons: agricultural subsidies, misguided dietary recommendations, industry lobbying, unfounded fear of fat.

  .red[b] Energy and protein requirements, World Health Organization

  .red[c] Meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies for estimating protein requirements in healthy adults, Rand et al.

## How-To
### Getting Started
### What to eat
]
.right-column[
Safe to eat:
- saturated and monounsatured fat: animal fat, coconut cream and oil, dark chocolate (>85%), olive oil, avocados
- non-starchy (green) vegetables: spinach, salad, ...
- meat: beef and lamb, eggs
- oily fish: tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon
- berries and fatty nuts in small amounts

These foods should be avoided:
- all sugar, added sugar and sugar-drinks
- any high-gycemic index.red[a] foods
- wheat, starches, rice, legumes
- fruits, fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, all fruit smoothies
- polyunsaturated fats (especially omega-6), especially from vegetable oils

.footnote[
  .red[a] High-GI foods rise your glucose level faster, thus triggering a stronger insulin response.

## Markers
]
.right-column[
Track your progress using these markers.
- waist/height ratio `< .5`: unhealthy fat will gather around the waist, free to measure.
- blood pressure `< 120/80`: Elevation can be a sign of atherosclerosis or stress.
- Triglycerides/HDL ratio `< 2`: Rough estimator of insulin resistance and LDL particle size.
- fasting insulin `< 8`
- HDL `> 65`: Has many useful functions, can reverse atherosclerosis, can be increased by eating saturated and monounsatured fats, exercise and *moderate* amounts of red wine.
- HbA1c `< 4.5%`: Long-term blood glucose.
- hs-CRP `< .1`: Inflammation marker, elevated when consuming PUFA and wheat.
- TSH `< 1`: Thyroid-stimulating hormon, should be low for good thyroid/immune system function.

Irrelevant markers:
- total cholesterol
- LDL cholesterol, LDL particle size is more relevant.
