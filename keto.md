### What to gain from a low-carb lifestyle?
- naturally control your weight and prevent obesity.red[a, j]
- improve memory and brain function.red[b]
- prevent modern chronic metabolic disease like 
  - type 2 diabetes.red[c]
  - Alzheimer's.red[d, i] and Parkinson.red[h]
  - heart attack, stroke and CVD.red[e]
- slow aging.red[f] and support apoptosis and autophagy
- reduce migraines and other neurological disease.red[g]

## Why it Works
### Primary effects
]
.right-column[
### Primary effects of carb restriction
- Keep glucose low, keep insulin low
- Body oxidizes fat instead of storing it.
- No glucose/insulin fluctuations > stable energy
- No development of insulin resistance > avoid all kinds of diabetes.
- Fat is a cleaner fuel.red[a, b, c, d, e] > fewer free radicals, less inflammation, more capacity for repair work.

.footnote[
  .red[a] Carbs only give 4 calories energy per g vs 9 cal/g for fat. While burning fat, 30% less carbonoxide is produced which points to fewer by-products.

### Secondary benefits of a low-carb diet
- Avoid fructose > useless to the body, processed like alcohol, stored as visceral fat around organs..red[f, g]
- Avoid wheat > reduce chronic inflammation of the gut.red[a]
- Avoid polyunsaturated fat > reduce cancer risk and inflammation.red[e]
- More nutritionally dense food > improved micros
- Reduced appetite > easy fasting > autophagy.red[b] and apoptosis.red[c]
- Fewer fermentable carbohydrates > less tooth decay and cavity.red[d]

## How-To
### Getting Started
]
.right-column[
### Reduce carbohydrates by chaning your macro-nutrients

3 macro-nutrients:
- *Carbohydrates*: Intake dramatically increased since 1960s..red[a]
- *Fat*: Safest food of all, no insulin reaction, clean and efficient fuel
- *Protein*: Constant at 1.4g (female: 1.2g) per kg ideal body weight per day.red[b]

How to start your ketogenic diet:
- Shift macros from carbs to fat, protein constant.
- Less than 20g net carbs per day.
- 2 weeks adaption phase, with temporary side-effects.red[c]
- Short fasting periods, e.g. 16:8 hours can be helpful.
- Track food intake in the first weeks.

.footnote[
  .red[a] Possible Reasons: agricultural subsidies, misguided dietary recommendations, industry lobbying, unfounded fear of fat.

  .red[b] *Metabolic Aspects of a Protein-Sparing Modified Fast in the Dietary Management of Prader-Willi Obesity*, Bistrian et al.

## How-To

### Low-carb foods
### High-carb foods
### What to eat
]
.right-column[
Safe to eat:
- saturated and monounsatured fat: animal fat, coconut cream and oil, dark chocolate (>85%), olive oil, avocados
- non-starchy (green) vegetables: spinach, salad, ...
- meat: beef and lamb, eggs
- oily fish: tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon
- berries and fatty nuts in small amounts

These foods should be avoided:
- all sugar, added sugar and sugar-drinks
- any high-gycemic index.red[a] foods
- wheat, starches, rice, legumes
- fruits, fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, all fruit smoothies
- polyunsaturated fats (especially omega-6), especially from vegetable oils

.footnote[
  .red[a] High-GI foods rise your glucose level faster, thus triggering a stronger insulin response.

## Markers
]
.right-column[
Track your progress using these markers.
- waist/height ratio `< .45`: unhealthy fat will gather around the waist, free to measure.
- blood pressure `< 120/80`: Elevation can be a sign of atherosclerosis.
- Triglycerides/HDL ratio `< 1.5`: Rough estimator of insulin resistance and LDL particle size.
- fasting insulin `< 8`
- HDL `> 65`: Has many useful functions, can reverse atherosclerosis, can be increased by eating saturated and monounsatured fats, exercise and *moderate* amounts of red wine.
- HbA1c `< 4.5%`: Long-term blood glucose.
- hs-CRP `< .1`: Inflammation marker, elevated when consuming PUFA and wheat.
- TSH `< 1`: Thyroid-stimulating hormon, should be low for good thyroid/immune system function.

Irrelevant markers:
- total cholesterol
- LDL cholesterol, LDL particle size is more relevant.
