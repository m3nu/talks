## Why it Works
### Primary effects
]
.right-column[
### Primary effects of carb restriction
- keep glucose and insulin low
- no glucose/insulin fluctuations > stable energy
- no insulin resistance > no diabetes or related disease
- body doesn't store excess glucose as fat
- body switches to ketone bodies as primary fuel > higher efficiency.red[a], cleaner, easier to reach brain

.footnote[
  .red[a] Carbs only give 4 calories energy per g vs 9 cal/g for fat. This means less oxygen used and fewer free radicals produced in the process.

### Secondary benefits of a low-carb diet
- avoid fructose > useless to the body, processed like alcohol, stored as visceral fat around organs.
- avoid wheat > reduce chronic inflammation of the gut.red[a]
- avoid polyun fat > reduce cancer risk and inflammation
- more nutritionally dense food > improved micros
- reduced appetite > fasting > autophagy.red[b] and apoptosis.red[c]

## How-To
### Getting Started
]
.right-column[
3 macro-nutrients:
- protein: usually constant at ~1g/kg body weight
- carbohydrates: were dramatically increased since 1960s. Reasons: agricultural subsidies, misguided dietary recommendations, industry lobbying, unfounded fear of fat.
- fat: safest food of all, no insulin reaction, clean and efficient fuel

How to start your ketogenic diet:
- shift macros from carbs to fat, protein constant
- less than 30-50g net carbs per day
- measure urine ketones in the first weeks
- 2 weeks adaption phase, ~10% weight loss
- short fasting periods, like 16:8 hours
- track food intake

## How-To
### Getting Started
### What to eat
]

- eggs
- meat: beef and lamb
- oily fish: tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon
- berries
- fatty nuts: macadamia nuts

These foods should be avoided:
- all sugar, added sugar and sugar-drinks
- high-GI food
- wheat, starches, rice, legumes

## Markers
]
.right-column[
Track your progress using these simple markers. 
- Trig/HDL `< 1.5`: Rough estimator of insulin resistance
- HDL `> 65`: Has many useful functions, can reverse atherosclerosis, can be increased by eating saturated and monounsatured fats, exercise and *moderate* amounts of red wine.
- HbA1c `< 4.5%`: Long-term blood glucose.
- fasting insulin `< 8`
- waist/height ratio `< .45`: unhealthy fat will gather around the waist, free to measure.
- hs-CRP `< .1`: Inflammation marker, elevated when consuming PUFA and wheat.
- TSH `< 1`: Thyroid-stimulating hormon, should be low for good thyroid/immune system function.
- blood pressure `< 120/80`: Elevation can be a sign of atherosclerosis.

Irrelevant markers:
- total cholesterol
- LDL cholesterol
- Free T3
